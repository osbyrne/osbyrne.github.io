I study computers at Efrei. I play guitar on monday nigths in Paris. I like my eggs poached, but I might slowly soft scramble them for a friend, with a small amount of pepper. I like to read other people's stories naviguating and building software on Lobste.rs and hackernews. I started buying cryptocurrencies in 2019. I go to the gym, but I don't track anything because I don't care; I just want to be healthy and that's enough. I have started tracking my sleep because it is messed up and needs fixing. I bought the red light, usualy reserved for baby chickens or lizards, for my desk. As a teenaged I made smoke bombs with potassium nitrite, shurikens out of scrap metal plates and I can draw pretty well. Hand drawing used to be a very important skill, before the picture was invented. So was hand writing, before emails. I take some magnesium and some creatine. I love Near's blog and Fernando's and Nullchinchilla, among many others, which motivated me to write here. I was born in 2002.
